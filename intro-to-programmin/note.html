<h3>Comments on the stage0</h3>
<p>
	This stage is actually easy for me because I have before read some online books about HTML (but haven't kept my study though...).<br>
	<br>
	Anyway, I think courses at this stage are <b>great</b> for beginners getting out of the ignorance state. For me, it helps me make my understanding of HTML more <em>structured</em>.

	Sorry for reviewing my casual notetaking!
